### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arturo and this account contains (almost) all the projects I did so far within Politecnico di Milano.

Their significance for me is *priceless*: not because they represent my code-style, but because they represent what I had to go through to fill in my gaps.

Should you have anything to ask me, please reach me @ arturo.caliandro@mail.polimi.it: I always read e-mails :)

*Enjoy* ðŸŒ±
